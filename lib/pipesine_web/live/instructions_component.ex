      Code to music to.
      <br><br>
      A web app that encourages Elixir developers to explore sound through code. Through magic* general programming becomes a specific sonic experience.
      <br><br>
      What do |> sound like? Which is more musical: if, case, or cond? Will Enum.filter actually filter a sound?
      <br><br>
      Compose Elixir/compose music.

      Users have two options:
      <br><br>
          You are presented with code that could potentially use a refactoring. Initially it may sound like a chaotic mess. Refactoring may lead to more pleasant, harmonious, or musical output. What sounds "good" is a subjective judgment. What do your coder ears prefer? How far will you refactor?
      <br><br>
          You write code from scratch. Your first incantation initiates a basic drone. From there, write and listen until you are pleased with what you hear. Save your project after an entire defmodule, or after just one line!
